    "### 1.1 Problem Statement\n",
    "Airlines experience fluctuating passenger demand due to seasonal patterns, economic factors, and travel behavior changes. Accurate demand forecasting helps airlines optimize flight schedules, pricing, and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to **forecast future airline passenger demand** using historical flight data. By analyzing time-based patterns, we can identify trends, seasonality, and other factors influencing air travel volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Objective\n",
    "To build a **time series forecasting model** that predicts the **number of passengers** over future time periods (monthly or daily).  \n",
    "The goal is to enable data-driven planning for:\n",
    "- Flight scheduling  \n",
    "- Crew and resource management  \n",
    "- Ticket pricing strategies  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Key Questions\n",
    "- How has airline passenger demand changed over time?  \n",
    "- Are there visible seasonal trends (e.g., holidays, vacation months)?  \n",
    "- Which airlines show the most consistent growth or decline in demand?  \n",
    "- Which forecasting model (ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM) provides the most accurate predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Expected Outcome\n",
    "- A **forecast chart** showing predicted passenger demand for the next 6–12 months.  \n",
    "- **Insights** into patterns such as trends, seasonality, and volatility.  \n",
    "- A **report summary** comparing model accuracy and recommending the best forecasting approach.\n"
